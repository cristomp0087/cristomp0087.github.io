        <h2>The Life of HTML & CSS</h2>

<p>
  <em>"DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!"</em><br>
  That handwritten note, taped to a computer at CERN, kept the first website alive. 
  The Internet’s origin story began not with a billion-dollar startup, but with a desperate post-it and a lot of trust.
</p>

<p>
  Before 1993, the Internet already existed — a network of computers quietly ignoring each other.  
  It took <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> to give it a common language: 
  the <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>.  
  HTML introduced hyperlinks and structure, turning raw data into readable pages. 
  In short, Tim taught machines how to talk — and humans how to click.
</p>

<p>
  A year later, <strong>Håkon Wium Lie</strong> realized that structure wasn’t enough — 
  the Web needed style. He created <strong>CSS</strong>, giving HTML a voice, a color palette, 
  and a better outfit. Together, they made the Internet not just functional, but beautiful — 
  a place where logic meets art and cat videos.
</p>

<p>
  Decades later, every scroll, every click, and every broken link still trace back to them.  
  HTML and CSS remain the quiet, witty architects of the digital world —  
  invisible, essential, and occasionally sarcastic.  
  <br><br>
  <em>They built the foundation of our connected lives, 
  and did it all for free. So think about that next time you draw a cat and demand copyright.</em>

  <h2>Facts About HTML & CSS</h2>
  <ul>

  <li>Tim Berners-Lee was known for his dry, geeky sense of humor , the kind that could easily pass as a Dad Joke. He once joked that his only regrets were “a few HTML tags and broken links.”</li>
  <li>Berners-Lee never made money from his invention; he gave the Web to the world for free. In recognition of that, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II and became <strong>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</strong>.</li>
  <li>The very first website is still online — a digital time capsule hosted by CERN. >> http://info.cern.ch</li>
  <li>HTML builds the structure, and CSS gives it beauty — a perfect parent-child relationship in web design.</li>
</ul>
