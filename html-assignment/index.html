        <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>My name is Cris and I am from Brazil. Now I live in Ottawa with my wife and children. I study <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> at Algonquin College. In the past I worked with interior design and carpentry. Moving to another country was difficult, but it helps me to learn and grow. I try every day to adapt and to be stronger, and I see this as my 1<sup>st</sup> big challenge in Canada.</p>
          <p>I like to write stories, read books, and play the violin. Creativity is <em>very important</em> for me because it gives me energy and meaning. I believe that learning never stops. Even when life is not easy, I want to continue forward. My goal is to turn normal experiences into something that has value and makes sense.</p>
